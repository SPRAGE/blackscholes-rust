# Black-Scholes Rust

A Black-Scholes pricing model built in Rust. This is a basic Black-Scholes implementation assuming no dividends and European option. The current implentation is using historical volatility in the calculation from a provided csv but can be changed to a more advanced method to increase accuracy. This implementation does not prioritze speed though it should be pretty effecient.
